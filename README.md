# SDE
## Simple Decrypter / Encrypter 
### What is this program?
This program is a simple decrypter and encrypter. You enter a password and it randomly* encrypts it and returns your encrypted password and a decryption key. You enter them both in and it decrypts your password, simple as that. This program is under development and is subject to change.

### How do I use this program?
Just go to the release folder and install the SDE.exe file.
Then run it. That's all, no extra installations necessary.
Once running it will prompt you to select encryption or decryption.
Once selected enter the password and if necessary the encryption key.

### To-Do
- Create truly random encryption.
- Create a UI using direct X

### License
All usage must fall under what's acceptable in the license agreement.

### Disclaimer
Does not work on MacOS have not checked linux. 
I cannot guarantee the security of the encrypted password. Please do not use this for anything that matters. User discretion advised.

*The encryption is not random but is a random + or - 5 shift encryption.
