# SDE
## Simple Decrypter / Encrypter 
### What is this program?
This program is a simple decrypter and encrypter. You enter a password and it randomly* encrypts it and returns your encrypted password and a decryption key. You enter them both in and it decrypts your password, simple as that. This program is under development and is subject to change. The program can also generate passwords. (Defaulted to 16 characters can be changed in passwords.h)
